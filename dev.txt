we released MetaOS to fill the promess of a new OS by 3 months
unfortunately, we have gone through development hell for more than 3 times, each time saying to focus
on the consumer.

the name metaos is only to mark it as new and improved and shiny, consumers don't know what awaits them.
when we release prismOS 4.0 this is gonna be hit. a massive one. just you wait.

we are nearing development ending. project started back in august and now we are finishing it.

consumer preview has been released!

after 60 hours + of work on the OS we have released the OS and as i predicted it, its a wild hit.
the os is being so much used that glitch.com had to ratelimit the OS page lollll

was worth it.
